Attempted to tamper with a application, but it's not ready yet.
Registrations on a application are open until the application is ready for
providing. Only once the application is ready for providing, registrations will
be closed, and then they can only be enabled again by calling
application.tamper().
Keep in mind that reopening a application is meant for testing or alternative
scenarios
