Attempted to install provider 'AnotherProvider' which provides for 'SomeModule',
but 'SomeProvider' was already installed as its provider.

Overriding providers is not allowed. You can enable overriding a provider after
the application is ready tampering with it:
    application.tamper(allow_overrides=True)

Keep in mind that overriding providers is mostly meant for testing and
alternative running scenarios.
