Requested to provide AnotherProvider.b, but 'AnotherProvider' was not installed.

'AnotherProvider' provides for 'SomeModule', but that module is being provided
by 'SomeProvider'.

AnotherProvider: "src/seamful/application/test_application.py"
SomeModule: "src/seamful/application/test_application.py"
SomeProvider: "src/seamful/application/test_application.py"
