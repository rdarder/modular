Module SubModule inherits from 'SomeModule'

    class SubModule(SomeModule, ...):
        ...

But modules must inherit directly from Module, and only from Module.
Subclassing another module is not supported. Depending on your use case, you'll
likely need to just use two different, orthogonal modules
