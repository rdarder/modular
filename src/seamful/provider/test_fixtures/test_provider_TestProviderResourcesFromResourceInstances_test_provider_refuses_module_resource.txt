Provider 'SomeProvider' defines resource 'a' as

    a = Resource(int, kind=ResourceKind.MODULE)

But providers can only have overriding or private resources. If you meant to
define a private resource, you could do:

    a = Resource(int, ResourceKind.PRIVATE)

SomeProvider: "src/seamful/provider/test_provider.py"
