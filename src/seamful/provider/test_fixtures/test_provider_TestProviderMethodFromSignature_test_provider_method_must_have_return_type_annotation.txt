The provider method SomeProvider.provide_a doesn't have a return type.
All provider methods must have a return type annotation compatible with the
resource they provide for. In this case it provides for

    SomeModule.a = Resource(int)

So the return type must be compatible with 'int'

SomeProvider: "src/seamful/provider/test_provider.py"
