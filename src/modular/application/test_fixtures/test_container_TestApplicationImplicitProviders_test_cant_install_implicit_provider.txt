Attempted to install provider 'AnotherProvider' which provides for
'AnotherModule', which is not registered. Registered modules are:
    - SomeModule

Registering providers for implicit modules is only meant to be used for testing
and secondary scenarios, and can be enabled by tampering with the application:
    application.tamper(allow_implicit_modules=True)

If instead, the application is expected to provide resources for
'AnotherModule', you can register both at once by calling:
    application.register(AnotherModule, provider=AnotherProvider)
