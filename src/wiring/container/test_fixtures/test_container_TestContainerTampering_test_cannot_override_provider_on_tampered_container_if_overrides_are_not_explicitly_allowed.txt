Attempted to register provider 'AnotherProvider' which provides for
'SomeModule', but 'SomeProvider' was already registered as its provider.

Overriding providers is not allowed. You can enable overriding a provider after
the container is ready tampering with it:
    container.tamper(allow_overrides=True)

Keep in mind that overriding providers is mostly meant for testing and
alternative running scenarios.
