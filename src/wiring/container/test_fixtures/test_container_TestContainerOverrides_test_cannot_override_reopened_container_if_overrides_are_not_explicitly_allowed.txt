Attempted to register provider 'AnotherProvider' which provides for
'SomeModule', but 'SomeProvider' was already registered as its provider.

Overriding providers is not allowed. You can override a provider after the
container closed registrations by reopening it as follows:
    container.reopen_registrations(allow_overriding_providers=True)

Keep in mind that overriding providers is mostly meant for testing and
alternative running scenarios.
