Provider 'AnotherProvider' defines an attribute 'a'

    a: SomeProvider.a

But it's an annotation without a value and refers to an unrelated Provider. It's
likely that you intended to define instead:

    a = Resource(SomeConcreteClass, override=True)

AnotherProvider: src/wiring/provider/test_provider.py:1075
